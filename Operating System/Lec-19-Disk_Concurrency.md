# Disk

## Components
- Cylinders（柱面）: a collection of tracks in the same relative position to the spindle
- tracks（磁道）: a concentric circle on a single platter（盘面） side
- sectors（扇区）: segments of a track (usually 512B or 4KB in size). Sectors usually have an equal number of bytes in them, consisting of a reamble, data, and an error correcting code (ECC).
