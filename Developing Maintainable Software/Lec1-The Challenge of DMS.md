## Three principles for developing maintainable software
- Maintainability benefits most from adhering to simple guidelines
- Maintainability is not an afterthought, but should be addressed from the very beginning of a development project
- Some violations are worse than others; the more a software system complies with the guidelines, the more maintainable it is

## Three Main Categories of Maintenance
- Corrective Maintenance
  - Finding and fixing errors in the system
- Adaptive Maintenance
  â€“ The system has to be adapted to changes in the environment in which it operates
- Perfective + Preventive Maintenance
  - Users of the system (and/or other stakeholders) have new or changed requirements
  - Ways are identified to increase quality or prevent future bugs from occurring
  
## What is involved in Software Maintenance?
- Understanding the client (need to listen and translate into requirements)
- Understanding the existing code (often harder than you think)
- Refactoring the existing code (apply the guidelines for developing maintainable code)
- Extending the existing code (adding functionality)
- Working as a team
- Managing client expectations (deliver what the client wants to a high standard in time)
- Managing the maintenance process (same as development; need to be organised)
